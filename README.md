**IDEAS** 

Our idea is to develop a command prompt based game which is a generic word guessing and intelligence questions game with some additional features in it which differ it from other existing games in the market. 

**MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVE** 

This game follows the ideology of one of the most iconic game, hangman. We plan to revive hangman game once again with some cool additional features so people can play it in their free time in this tough situation and this game will help people enhance their knowledge by learning new words. It will also have IQ section which will have a 20 questions quiz for the player so Users can rank their IQ among others.  

**FEATURES** 

This game has the following features:  

1) Command prompt based game for PC  
1) Wide variety of Guessing words  
1) 2 life’s for players(people can have 2 wrong guesses  )  
1) Message box feature before closing the game or starting the game to avoid accident termination of application.  
1) 2 Help lines for the player (Friend and life line) 6)   More than 100 IQ questions.  

\7)   2 life’s for players in IQ game. 

**METHODOLOGY** 

The game we have designed consists of two main sections one of which is  Hangman  Type Game in which word will be guessed and another would be the Knowledge Tester IQ Question Based Game. Our Game has random pick of questions and words which increases its difficulty level as even the moderator/developer wouldn’t be able to guess which word is it without trying their luck. We have introduce new feature of helpline which enhances the features of this game and make this reality based game which are usual in our daily lives. Some of the snaps of working models is shown below.  

**TECHNOLOGIES USED** 

1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  
1. Irvine32 Library.  

**CONCLUSION** 

This game is a merge of two main games that are general knowledge quiz game and hangman. This is unique in a way that it will provide user chance to play a game of his own choice and as well compete on the basis of previous scores.
